# 🎭 Master of Jokes  
**Backend-Focused Full-Stack Web Application**

Master of Jokes is a backend-driven full-stack web application built using Python and Flask.  
This project was developed as a **project** to demonstrate backend engineering fundamentals, database integration, clean project structure, and deployment readiness.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Developed a Flask-based web application with server-side routing and business logic  
- Integrated a relational database using ORM patterns  
- Designed the project following production-style architecture  
- Containerized the application to ensure consistent development and deployment  

This project showcases end-to-end ownership of a real-world web application, from backend logic to deployment configuration.

## ✅ Conclusion

Master of Jokes demonstrates my ability to design, build, and prepare a backend-focused full-stack application using industry-standard tools and practices. 
Through this project, I applied core software engineering principles such as clean architecture, database modeling, and environment-independent deployment.
The project reflects end-to-end ownership,from implementing backend logic and integrating a database to containerizing the application and preparing it for production use. 
It serves as a strong representation of my backend and full-stack development skills and my readiness to work on real-world software systems.
